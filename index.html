<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>As the world goes multi-platform with all of the new mobile operating
systems, MultiMarkdown provides an easy way to share formatting between all of
my devices. It&#8217;s easy to learn (even for us mortals) and immediately useful.</p>

<h3 id="whatismarkdown">What is Markdown?</h3>

<p>To understand what MultiMarkdown is, you first should be familiar with
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Daring Fireball:
Markdown">Markdown</a>. The best description of what Markdown is comes from John Gruber&#8217;s
Markdown web site:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown
allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).</p>

<p>Thus, &#8220;Markdown&#8221; is two things: (1) a plain text formatting
syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts
the plain text formatting to HTML. See the Syntax page for details
pertaining to Markdown’s formatting syntax. You can try it out,
right now, using the online Dingus.</p>

<p>The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to
make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted
document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While
Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing
text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for
Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. &#8212; <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Daring Fireball: Markdown">John Gruber</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="whatismultimarkdown">What is MultiMarkdown?</h3>

<p>Markdown is great, but it lacked a few features that would allow it to work
with documents, rather than just pieces of a web page.</p>

<p>I wrote MultiMarkdown in order to leverage Markdown&#8217;s syntax, but to extend it
to work with complete documents that could ultimately be converted from text
into other formats, including complete HTML documents, LaTeX, PDF, ODF, or
even (shudder) Microsoft Word documents.</p>

<p>In addition to the ability to work with complete documents and conversion to
other formats, the Markdown syntax was lacking a few other things. Michel
Fortin added a few additional syntax features when writing <a href="http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/">PHP Markdown
Extra</a>. Some of his ideas were implemented and expanded on in MultiMarkdown,
in addition to including features not available in other Markdown
implementations. These features include tables, footnotes, citation support,
image and link attributes, cross-references, math support, and more.</p>

<p>John Gruber may disagree with me, but I really did try to stick with his
proclaimed vision whenever I added a new syntax format to MultiMarkdown. The
quality that attracted me to Markdown the most was its clean format. Reading a
plain text document written in Markdown is <em>easy</em>. It makes sense, and it
looks like it was designed for people, not computers. To the extent possible,
I tried to keep this same concept in mind when working on MultiMarkdown.</p>

<p>I may or may not have succeeded in this&#8230;.</p>

<p>In the vein of Markdown&#8217;s multiple definitions, you can think of MultiMarkdown
as:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A program to convert plain text to a fully formatted document.</p></li>
<li><p>The syntax used in the plain text to describe how to convert it to a
 complete document.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="whyshouldiusemultimarkdown">Why should I use MultiMarkdown?</h3>

<p>Writing with MultiMarkdown allows you to separate the content and structure of
your document from the formatting. You focus on the actual writing, without
having to worry about making the styles of your chapter headers match, or
ensuring the proper spacing between paragraphs. And with a little forethought,
a single plain text document can easily be converted into multiple output
formats without having to rewrite the entire thing or format it by hand. Even
better, you don&#8217;t have to write in &#8220;computer-ese&#8221; to create well formatted
HTML or LaTeX commands. You just write, MultiMarkdown takes care of the rest.</p>

<p>For example, instead of writing:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;In order to create valid 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt;, you 
need properly coded syntax that can be cumbersome for 
&amp;#8220;non-programmers&amp;#8221; to write. Sometimes, you
just want to easily make certain words &lt;strong&gt;bold
&lt;/strong&gt;, and certain words &lt;em&gt;italicized&lt;/em&gt; without
having to remember the syntax. Additionally, for example,
creating lists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should be easy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;should not involve programming&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You simply write:</p>

<pre><code>In order to create valid [HTML], you need properly
coded syntax that can be cumbersome for 
&quot;non-programmers&quot; to write. Sometimes, you just want
to easily make certain words **bold**, and certain 
words *italicized* without having to remember the 
syntax. Additionally, for example, creating lists:

* should be easy
* should not involve programming

[HTML]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, you can write a MultiMarkdown document in any text editor, on
any operating system, and know that it will be compatible with MultiMarkdown
on any other operating system and processed into the same output. As a plain
text format, your documents will be safe no matter how many times you switch
computers, operating systems, or favorite applications. You will always be
able to open and edit your documents, even when the version of the software
you originally wrote them in is long gone.</p>

<p>These features have prompted several people to use MultiMarkdown in the
process of writing their books, theses, and countless other documents.</p>

<p>There are many other reasons to use MultiMarkdown, but I won&#8217;t get into all of
them here.</p>

<p><em>By the way</em> &#8212; the MultiMarkdown web site is, of course, created using
MultiMarkdown. To view the MMD source for any page, add <code>.txt</code> to the end of
the URL. If the URL ends with <code>/</code>, then add <code>index.txt</code> to the end instead.
The main MultiMarkdown page, for example, would be
<a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/index.txt">http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/index.txt</a>.</p>

<h3 id="whereisthisguidekept">Where is this Guide Kept?</h3>

<p>This User&#8217;s Guide is designed to be viewed as a single HTML document, or as a
PDF after being processed by LaTeX. When processed by MultiMarkdown and
viewed as a single document, it will demonstrate many of the features that
MultiMarkdown offers, and should be fairly easy to navigate.</p>

<p>The source text documents are actually stored in a wiki on Github so that the
document can easily be worked on by anyone with a Github account:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/wiki/User's-Manual">https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/wiki/User's-Manual</a></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note</em>: Currently, the Github wiki software supports Markdown, but not
MultiMarkdown. This means that certain MultiMarkdown specific features will
not work on the wiki, but will work when the source is processed by
MultiMarkdown separately from the wiki.</p>

<p>You can download a copy of the source files using the instructions contained
at the wiki itself. Additionally, the source is linked to from within the
source project for MultiMarkdown in the <code>documentation</code> directory. If you
download the source, you can can compile a copy of the documentation
automatically with:</p>

<pre><code>make docs
</code></pre>

<p>(This command requires perl to be installed &#8212; maybe at some point I&#8217;ll work
on an alternative for Windows users without perl).</p>

<h2 id="howdoiinstallmultimarkdown">How do I install MultiMarkdown?</h2>

<p>The &#8220;Basic&#8221; instructions below will get you a functioning installation of
MultiMarkdown, including the following commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>multimarkdown</code></li>
<li><code>mmd</code></li>
<li><code>mmd2tex</code></li>
<li><code>mmd2opml</code></li>
<li><code>mmd2odf</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The &#8220;Advanced&#8221; instructions will help if you want to make use of some of the
more advanced features, such as custom XSLT output, you will need to install
the MultiMarkdown Support files.</p>

<p>If you want to use the LaTeX features, it would be helpful to install the
LaTeX support files.</p>

<p>The instructions are provided for several operating systems:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#macosx">Mac OS X</a></li>
<li><a href="#windows">Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="#linux">Linux</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="macosx">Mac OS X</h3>

<h4 id="basic">Basic</h4>

<p>On the Mac, you can choose from using an installer to install the program and
required libraries for you, or you can compile it yourself from scratch. If
you know what that means, follow the instructions below in the Linux section.
Otherwise, definitely go for the installer!</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the latest version of the <code>MultiMarkdown-Mac</code> installer from the
 <a href="http://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads">downloads</a> page</li>
<li>Unzip the downloaded file, then run the installer and follow the onscreen
 directions.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="advanced">Advanced</h4>

<p>If you want to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a> to customize your output, or you want to use
MultiMarkdown with <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html">Scrivener</a> or <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, you should also download and
run the <code>MultiMarkdown-Support-Mac</code> <a href="http://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads">installer</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to use LaTeX to generate PDFs, I recommend downloading the LaTeX
<a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown-latex-support">support files</a> and placing them in
<code>~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/mmd</code>.</p>

<h4 id="compiling">Compiling</h4>

<p>The instructions for compiling on Mac OS X are similar to the <a href="#linux">Linux</a>
instructions below. If you want to build an installer, you can switch to the
<code>mac-installer</code> branch, and use the <code>make mac-installer</code> command.</p>

<p>On Mac OS X, please note that you will need to install the Developer Tools.
You then need to install a few libraries. I used <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew">homebrew</a>:</p>

<pre><code>brew install pkg-config glib gettext
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">fink</a> or something similar (though this caused some machine
architecture incompatibilities for me):</p>

<pre><code>fink install glib2-shlibs glib2-dev
</code></pre>

<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>

<h4 id="basic">Basic</h4>

<p>The easiest way to install MMD on Windows is the <code>MultiMarkdown-Windows</code>
installer from the <a href="http://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads">downloads</a> page and run it. The installer is built using
software by <a href="http://bitrock.com/">BitRock</a>.</p>

<p>Just as with the Mac OS X version, the installer includes the <code>multimarkdown</code>
binary, as well as several convenience scripts.</p>

<p>You can use Windows Explorer to create shortcuts to the <code>multimarkdown</code>
binary, and adjust the properties to allow you to create &#8220;drag and drop&#8221;
versions of MMD as well.</p>

<h4 id="advanced">Advanced</h4>

<p>If you intend to use LaTeX to generate PDFs, you will need to install a
working version of LaTeX. I have used <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a>
in the past, but the details of installing that are up to you. I would also
recommend installing the LaTeX <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown-latex-support">support files</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a> to customize your output, you will need to install a
working version of <code>xsltproc</code> and a program to allow you to run shell scripts
so that you can use the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MMD-Support">MMD-Support</a> utility scripts. This is fairly
complicated to install on Windows, so I highly recommend that you determine
whether you really need these features. Most of the customizations you need
can actually be done within the LaTeX include files specified in the metadata,
without requiring XSLT. Check out some of the examples in the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-Gallery">MultiMarkdown
Gallery</a> and in the LaTeX Support files for ideas of what can be done.</p>

<h4 id="compiling">Compiling</h4>

<p>If you want to compile this yourself, you do it in the same way that you would
install peg-markdown for Windows. The instructions are on the
peg-multimarkdown <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/wiki/Building-for-Windows">wiki</a>. I
was able to compile for Windows fairly easily using Ubuntu linux following
those instructions. I have not tried to actually compile on a Windows machine.</p>

<p>Otherwise, see the section on <a href="#linux">Linux</a> for further tips.</p>

<p>(For those who are interested, I actually created an EC2 instance on Amazon
and installed the necessary software to compile. It was pretty easy and
probably cost me $0.02&#8230;)</p>

<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>

<h4 id="basiccompiling">Basic compiling</h4>

<p>Currently the only way to install MultiMarkdown on *nix machines is to compile
it yourself. You need to have <code>glib2</code> installed. For example, on ubuntu:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev
</code></pre>

<p>For other linux distributions, you will need to do something similar.</p>

<p>Once you have the libraries installed, you can either download the source from
the <a href="http://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads">downloads</a> page, or (preferentially) you can use git:</p>

<pre><code>git clone --recursive git://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown.git
</code></pre>

<p>At this point you can compile with:</p>

<pre><code>make
</code></pre>

<h4 id="advancedcompiling">Advanced compiling</h4>

<p>One additional step to include if you use git to clone the source, is to run
the <code>update_submodules.sh</code> script. This script basically runs two commands,
that you can also run by hand:</p>

<pre><code>git submodule init
git submodule update
</code></pre>

<p>Then, simply run <code>make</code> to compile the source. You can also run some test
commands to verify that everything is working properly. Of note, it is normal
to fail one test in the Markdown tests, but the others should pass. You can
then install the binary and utility scripts wherever you like, though for
consistency <code>/usr/local/bin</code> would probably be best.</p>

<pre><code>make
make test
make mmdtest
make latextest
</code></pre>

<p>As above, if you intend to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>, and the like, I recommend also
installing the LaTeX Support <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown-latex-support">files</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MMD-Support">MultiMarkdown
Support</a>.</p>

<h2 id="howdoiusemultimarkdown">How do I use MultiMarkdown?</h2>

<p>There are several ways to use MultiMarkdown, depending on your needs. You can
use the <code>multimarkdown</code> command line tool, you can use MultiMarkdown with
several applications that support it directly, or you can use a drag and drop
approach.</p>

<h3 id="commandlineusage">Command Line Usage</h3>

<p>First, verify that you have properly installed MultiMarkdown:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -v
</code></pre>

<p>If you don&#8217;t see a message telling you which version of MultiMarkdown is
installed, check out Troubleshooting.</p>

<p>To learn more about the command line options to multimarkdown:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -h
</code></pre>

<p>Once you have properly installed MultiMarkdown:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>will convert the plain text file <code>file.txt</code> into HTML output. To save the
results to a file:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown file.txt &gt; file.html
</code></pre>

<p>A shortcut to this is to use MultiMarkdown&#8217;s batch mode, which will save the
output to the same base filename that is input, with the extension <code>.html</code> (or
<code>.tex</code> for LaTeX output):</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -b file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>A benefit of batch mode is that you can process multiple files at once:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -b file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to create LaTeX output instead of HTML:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -t latex file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>For OPML:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -t opml file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>And for an OpenDocument text file:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -t odf file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>There are also several convenience scripts included with MultiMarkdown:</p>

<pre><code>mmd file.txt
mmd2tex file.txt
mmd2opml file.txt
mmd2odf file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>These scripts run MultiMarkdown in batch mode to generate HTML, LaTeX, OPML,
or ODF files respectively. These scripts are included with the Mac or Windows
installers, and are available for *nix in the <code>scripts</code> directory in the
source project. They are intended to be used as shortcuts for the most common
command line options.</p>

<h4 id="commandlineoptions">Command Line Options</h4>

<p>There are several options when running MultiMarkdown from the command line.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -v, multimarkdown --version
</code></pre>

<p>Displays the version of MultiMarkdown currently installed.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -o, multimarkdown --output=FILE
</code></pre>

<p>Directs the output to the specified file. By default, the output is directed
to <code>stdout</code>. The use of <code>batch</code> mode obviates the need to use this option, but
if you want to specify a different output filename it can be handy.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -t html|latex|memoir|beamer|opml|odf
</code></pre>

<p>This options specified the format that MultiMarkdown outputs. The default is
html. If you use the <code>LaTeX Mode</code> metadata, then MultiMarkdown will
automatically choose <code>memoir</code> or <code>beamer</code> as directed without using these
command line options. Using that metadata will also allow the various
convenience scripts to choose the correct output format as well.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -x, multimarkdown --extensions
</code></pre>

<p>This turns on all extensions. It is really intended to be used when you would
like to use some of the extensions of peg-markdown. Probably not useful for
MultiMarkdown users, but I left it turned on just in case, except where it
interferes with the desired MMD functionality.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown --filter-html
multimarkdown --filter-styles
</code></pre>

<p>The first command causes any raw HTML (except styles) included in the source
document to <em>not</em> be included in the output. The second command removes HTML
style tags from the output.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -c, multimarkdown --compatibility
</code></pre>

<p>Compatibility mode causes MultiMarkdown to output HTML that is compatible
with that output from the original Markdown. This allows it to pass the
original Markdown test suite. Syntax features that don&#8217;t exist in regular
Markdown will still be output using the regular MultiMarkdown output
formatting.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -b, multimarkdown --batch
</code></pre>

<p>Automatically redirects the output to a file with the same base name as the
input file, but with the appropriate extension based on the output type. For
example, <code>multimarkdown -b file.txt</code> would output the HTML to <code>file.html</code>, and
<code>multimarkdown -b -t latex file.txt</code> would output to <code>file.tex</code>.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -e &quot;metakey&quot;, multimarkdown --extract &quot;metakey&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The extract feature outputs the value of the specified metadata key. This is
used in my convenience scripts to help choose the proper LaTeX output mode,
and could be used in other circumstances as well.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown --smart
</code></pre>

<p>Uses smart typography, similar to John Gruber&#8217;s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/">SmartyPants</a> program, which was included
in MultiMarkdown 2.0. This extension is turned on by default in MultiMarkdown.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown --notes
</code></pre>

<p>Enables the use of footnotes and similar markup (glossary, citations). Enabled
by default in MultiMarkdown.</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown --process-html
</code></pre>

<p>This option tells MultiMarkdown to process the text included within HTML tags
in the source document.</p>

<p>Other options are available by checking out <code>multimarkdown --help-all</code>, but
the ones listed above are the primary options.</p>

<h4 id="advancedmode">Advanced Mode</h4>

<p>MultiMarkdown version 2.0 had to first convert the source file to HTML, and
then applied XSLT files to convert to the final LaTeX format. Since
MultiMarkdown 3.0 can create LaTeX directly, this approach is no longer
necessary.</p>

<p>The one benefit of that approach, however, was that it became possible to
perform a wide range of customizations on exactly how the LaTeX output was
created by customizing the XSLT files.</p>

<p>If you install the Support files on Mac or Linux, you can still use the
advanced XSLT method to generate LaTeX output. For the time being, this
approach doesn&#8217;t work with Windows, but it would be fairly easy to create a
batch script or perl script to implement this feature on Windows.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, however, that because of the more advanced mechanism of handling
LaTeX in MultiMarkdown 3.0, you can do a great deal of customization without
needing to use an XSLT file.</p>

<p>The <code>mmd2tex-xslt</code> script will convert a plain text file into LaTeX that is
virtually identical with that created by the regular LaTeX approach.</p>

<p>There are a few differences in the two approaches, however:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Once a MultiMarkdown file is converted to HTML, it is impossible to tell
 whether the resulting HTML was generated by MultiMarkdown, or if it was
 included as raw HTML within the source document. So <em>either</em> way, it will
 be converted to the analagous LaTeX syntax. The <code>multimarkdown</code> binary on
 its own will <em>not</em> convert HTML into LaTeX.</p></li>
<li><p>The whitespace that is generated will be different under certain
 circumstances. Typically, this will result in one extra or one fewer blank
 lines with the the XSLT approach. Generally this will not be an issue, but
 when used with <code>&lt;!-- some comment --&gt;</code> it may cause a newline to be lost.</p></li>
<li><p>The default XSLT recognizes <code>class=&quot;noxslt&quot;</code> when applied to HTML entities,
 and will discard them from the output.</p></li>
<li><p>An XSLT can only be applied to a complete HTML document, not a &#8220;snippet&#8221;.
 Therefore, if you want to use the XSLT method, your file must have metadata
 that triggers a complete document (i.e. any metadata except &#8220;quotes
 language&#8221; or &#8220;base header level&#8221;).</p></li>
<li><p>Using XSL to process an HTML file will &#8220;de-obfuscate&#8221; any email addresses
 that were obfuscated by MultiMarkdown.</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h4>

<p>I recommend that you become familiar with the &#8220;basic&#8221; approach to using
MultiMarkdown before trying to experiment with XSLT. The basic approach is
faster, and easier, and the results can still be customized quite a bit.</p>

<p>Then you can experiment with modifying XSLT to further customize your output
as needed.</p>

<p>If you have XSLT files that you used in MultiMarkdown 2.0, you will likely
need to modify them to recognize the HTML output generated by MultiMarkdown
3.0. You can use the default XSLT files as a guide to what is different.</p>

<h3 id="macosxapplications">Mac OS X Applications</h3>

<p>There are several applications that have built-in support for MultiMarkdown,
or that can easily use it with a plug-in.</p>

<h4 id="usingmultimarkdownwithtextmate">Using MultiMarkdown with TextMate</h4>

<p>If you want to run MultiMarkdown from directly within <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>, you should
install my MultiMarkdown <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/markdown.tmbundle">bundle</a>. This is a modified version of the original
Markdown bundle for TextMate that includes better support for MultiMarkdown.</p>

<p>This bundle will work with MultiMarkdown 2.0, or with MultiMarkdown 3.0 if you
install the MultiMarkdown-Support files (available from the downloads
<a href="http://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads">page</a>).</p>

<h4 id="usingmultimarkdownwithscrivener">Using MultiMarkdown with Scrivener</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html">Scrivener</a> is a great program for writers using Mac OS X. It includes built
in support for MultiMarkdown. If you want to use MultiMarkdown 3.0 with
Scrivener, you need to install the Support files in <code>~/Library/Application
Support/MultiMarkdown</code>. The MultiMarkdown-Support installer is available from
the downloads <a href="http://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads">page</a> and will install these files for you.</p>

<h4 id="draganddrop">Drag and Drop</h4>

<p>You can use the Mac OS X drag and drop applications to allow you to convert
MultiMarkdown to other formats by dragging and dropping files in the Finder.
They are available from the <a href="http://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads">downloads</a> page, or by running <code>make drop</code> from
the command line in the <code>multimarkdown</code> source directory.</p>

<h4 id="multimarkdownandfinderquicklook">MultiMarkdown and Finder &#8220;Quick Look&#8221;</h4>

<p>Starting in Mac OS 10.5, the Finder has the ability to show a &#8220;Quick Look&#8221;
preview of the contents of a file. I have two Quick Look generators that allow
the finder to preview the contents of a MultiMarkdown text file as an HTML
preview. One works on plain text files, and one works on OPML files.</p>

<p>Available for download from <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/qlmultimarkdown/downloads">github</a>.</p>

<h3 id="usingmultimarkdowninwindows">Using MultiMarkdown in Windows</h3>

<p>You can use the same command line approach with Windows as described
previously. While there aren&#8217;t drag and drop applications per se for the
Windows system, you can use Windows Explorer to create links to the binary and
specify and desired command line options to change the default output format.
This will effectively allow you to create drag and drop applications for
Windows.</p>

<h3 id="multimarkdownandlatex">MultiMarkdown and LaTeX</h3>

<p>Of note <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> is a complex set of programs. MultiMarkdown doesn&#8217;t include
LaTeX in the installer &#8212; it&#8217;s up to the user to install a working LaTeX
setup on their machine if you want to use it.</p>

<p>What MultiMarkdown does is make it easier to generate documents using the
LaTeX syntax. It should handle 80% of the documents that 80% of MultiMarkdown
need. It doesn&#8217;t handle all circumstances, and sometimes you will need to hand
code your LaTeX yourself.</p>

<p>In those cases you have a few options. MultiMarkdown will pass text included
in HTML comments along to the LaTeX as raw output. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!--  This is raw \LaTeX \[ {e}^{i\pi }+1=0 \] --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also include your desired LaTeX code in a separate file and link to
it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- \input{somefile} --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you have questions about LaTeX itself, I can&#8217;t help. You&#8217;re welcome to send
your question to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/multimarkdown/">MultiMarkdown Discussion List</a>, and perhaps someone will
be able to offer some assistance. But you would be better off asking a group
dedicated to LaTeX instead.</p>

<p>If the problem is that MultiMarkdown itself is generating invalid LaTeX, then
of course I want to know about it so I can fix it.</p>

<h3 id="multimarkdownandopml">MultiMarkdown and OPML</h3>

<p>MultiMarkdown is well suited to plain text files, but it can also be useful to
work on MultiMarkdown documents in an outliner or mind-mapping application.
For this, it is easy to convert back and forth between OPML and plain text
MultiMarkdown.</p>

<p>To convert from a text file to OPML:</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -t opml -b file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>mmd2opml file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting OPML file uses the headings to build the outline structure, and
puts the text within each section as a not for the corresponding level of the
outline using the <code>_note</code> attribute. <strong>NOTE</strong>: not all outliners support this
attribute. On Mac OS X, <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a> is a fabulous outliner
that supports this field. If you&#8217;re into mind mapping software, <a href="http://www.ithoughts.co.uk/">iThoughts</a> works on the iPad/iPhone and supports import and
export with OPML and the <code>_note</code> attribute.</p>

<p>To convert from OPML, you can use various commands in from the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MMD-Support">MMD-Support</a> package:</p>

<pre><code>opml2HTML file.opml
opml2mmd file.opml
opml2LaTeX file.opml
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: These scripts require a working installation of <code>xsltproc</code>, and the
ability to run shell scripts. This should work by default on most
installations of Mac OS X or Linux, but will require these applications to be
installed separately on Windows.</p>

<h3 id="multimarkdownandopendocument">MultiMarkdown and OpenDocument</h3>

<p>It is also possible to convert a MultiMarkdown text file into a word
processing document for <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> or
<a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download">LibreOffice</a>. This file can then be
converted by one of those applications into RTF, or a Microsoft Word document,
or many other file formats. (If you&#8217;re not familiar with these applications,
they are worth checking out. I don&#8217;t understand why people use Microsoft
Office any more&#8230;)</p>

<pre><code>multimarkdown -b -t odf file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>mmd2odf file.txt
</code></pre>

<p>MultiMarkdown 2.0 had partial support for outputting an RTF file, and could do
it completely on Mac OS X by using Apple&#8217;s <code>textutil</code> program. MMD 3 no longer
directly supports RTF as an output format, but the Flat OpenDocument format is
a much better option.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: LibreOffice can open these Flat OpenDocument files by default, but
OpenOffice requires that you install the <code>OpenDocument-Text-Flat-XML.jar</code> file
available from the
<a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/downloads">downloads</a> page. To
install it, create a new document in OpenOffice (or open an existing one),
then go to the Tools-&gt;XML Filter Settings menu option. Use the &#8220;Open
Package&#8230;&#8221; button to import the downloaded <code>.jar</code> file.</p>

<h4 id="advanceduse">Advanced Use</h4>

<p>It is possible to use an XSLT file to customize the OpenDocument output from
MultiMarkdown. I suppose you could also write an XSLT to convert OpenDocument
into LaTeX, similar to the default ones that convert HTML into LaTeX.</p>

<p>You can also create an XSLT that converts the OpenDocument output and modifies
it to incorporate necessary customizations. While a little tricky to learn,
XSLT files can be quite powerful and you&#8217;re limited only by your imagination.</p>

<h4 id="limitations">Limitations</h4>

<p>There are several limitations to the OpenDocument Flat Text format:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>images are not fully supported &#8212; they work best if you specify a length
 and a width in &#8220;fixed&#8221; units (not &#8216;%&#8217;), or do not specify any dimensions.</p></li>
<li><p>citations are not supported &#8212; I would like to be able to do something
 here, but I suspect you will need to use an external tool for the time
 being</p></li>
<li><p>math features are not supported, though I hope to be able to implement this
 at some point in the future</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="howdoicreateamultimarkdowndocument">How do I create a MultiMarkdown document?</h2>

<p>The general concept in MultiMarkdown is that it should be easy for someone to
type a plain text file that is human-readable, and then use the MultiMarkdown
program to convert that text file into a more complicated computer language
such as HTML or LaTeX. This allows you to create high quality output without
having to spend hours and hours fiddling with font sizes, margins, etc.</p>

<p>The first step in learning to use MultiMarkdown is to learn how to use
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. MultiMarkdown is an
extension to Markdown, and builds off of the basic fundamentals used in
Markdown.</p>

<p>I recommend starting by familiarizing yourself with the Markdown <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">basics</a> and
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">syntax</a> pages.</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;re familiar with the basics of Markdown, it will be relatively easy
to pick up the advanced features included in MultiMarkdown.</p>

<h3 id="metadata">Metadata</h3>

<p>It is possible to include special metadata at the top of a MultiMarkdown
document, such as title, author, etc. This information can then be used to
control how MultiMarkdown processes the document, or can be used in certain
output formats in special ways.</p>

<pre><code>Title:   A Sample MultiMarkdown Document  
Author:  Fletcher T. Penney  
Date:    February 9, 2011  
Comment: This is a comment intended to demonstrate  
         metadata that spans multiple lines, yet  
         is treated as a single value.  
Test:    And this is a new key-value pair  
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax for including metadata is simple.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The metadata must begin at the very top of the document - no blank lines can
 precede it.</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata consists of the two parts - the <code>key</code> and the <code>value</code></p></li>
<li><p>The metadata key must begin at the beginning of the line. It must start with
 a letter or number, then the following characters can consist of letters,
 numbers, spaces, hyphens, or underscore characters.</p></li>
<li><p>The end of the metadata key is specified with a colon (&#8216;:&#8217;)</p></li>
<li><p>After the colon comes the metadata value, which can consist of pretty much
 any characters (including new lines). To keep multiline metadata values from
 being confused with additional metadata, I recommend indenting each new line
 of metadata. If your metadata value includes a colon, it <em>must</em> be indented
 to keep it from being treated as a new key-value pair.</p></li>
<li><p>While not required, I recommend using two spaces at the end of each line of
 metadata. This will improve the appearance of the metadata section if your
 document is processed by Markdown instead of MultiMarkdown.</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata keys are case insensitive and stripped of all spaces during
 processing. This means that <code>Base Header Level</code>, <code>base headerlevel</code>, and
 <code>baseheaderlevel</code> are all the same.</p></li>
<li><p>Metadata is processed as plain text, so it should <em>not</em> include
 MultiMarkdown markup. It is possible to create customized XSLT files that
 apply certain processing to the metadata value, but this is not the default
 behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>After the metadata is finished, a blank line triggers the beginning of the
 rest of the document.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="completedocumentsvssnippets">Complete documents vs &#8220;snippets&#8221;</h3>

<p>In order to include metadata information such as a title, the HTML document
created by MultiMarkdown must be &#8220;complete.&#8221; This means that it starts with
something that looks like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you include metadata in your document (with two exceptions), then you will
generate a complete document. If you don&#8217;t include metadata, then you will
instead generate a &#8220;snippet.&#8221; The snippet will just include the relevant
portion of HTML, but will not include the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> elements.</p>

<p>Metadata that is only intended to affect the way MultiMarkdown processes the
output will not trigger a complete document. Currently, this means you can use
<code>Base Header Level</code> or <code>Quotes Language</code> and still output a snippet if you
don&#8217;t include any other metadata.</p>

<p>Document formats other than HTML don&#8217;t have distinctions between complete
documents and snippets. Any included and relevant metadata will be included if
present.</p>

<h3 id="standardmetadatakeys">&#8220;Standard&#8221; Metadata keys</h3>

<p>There are a few metadata keys that are standardized in MultiMarkdown. You can
use any other keys that you desire, but you have to make use of them yourself.</p>

<p>My goal is to keep the list of &#8220;standard&#8221; metadata keys as short as possible.</p>

<h4 id="author">Author</h4>

<p>This value represents the author of the document and is used in LaTeX
documents to generate the title information.</p>

<h4 id="affiliation">Affiliation</h4>

<p>This is used to enter further information about the author &#8212; a link to a
website, an employer, academic affiliation, etc.</p>

<h4 id="baseheaderlevel">Base Header Level</h4>

<p>This is used to change the top level of organization of the document. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Base Header Level: 2

# Introduction #
</code></pre>

<p>Normally, the Introduction would be output as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> in HTML, or <code>\part{}</code> in
LaTeX. If you&#8217;re writing a shorter document, you may wish for the largest
division in the document to be <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> or <code>\chapter{}</code>. The <code>Base Header Level</code>
metadata tells MultiMarkdown to change the largest division level to the
specified value.</p>

<p>This can also be useful when combining multiple documents.</p>

<p><code>Base Header Level</code> does not trigger a complete document.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are &#8220;flavors&#8221; of this metadata key for various output
formats so that you can specify a different header level for different output
formats &#8212; i.e. <code>LaTeX Header Level</code>, <code>HTML Header Level</code>, and <code>ODF Header
Level</code>.</p>

<h4 id="bibliostyle">Biblio Style</h4>

<p>This metadata specifies the name of the BibTeX style to be used, if you are
not using natbib.</p>

<h4 id="bibtex">BibTeX</h4>

<p>This metadata specifies the name of the BibTeX file used to store citation
information. Do not include the trailing &#8216;.bib&#8217;.</p>

<h4 id="copyright">Copyright</h4>

<p>This can be used to provide a copyright string.</p>

<h4 id="css">CSS</h4>

<p>This metadata specifies a URL to be used as a CSS file for the produced
document. Obviously, this is only useful when outputting to HTML.</p>

<h4 id="date">Date</h4>

<p>Specify a date to be associated with the document.</p>

<h4 id="htmlheader">HTML Header</h4>

<p>You can include raw HTML information to be included in the header.
MultiMarkdown doesn&#8217;t perform any validation on this data &#8212; it just copies
it as is.</p>

<p>As an example, this can be useful to link your document to a working MathJax
installation (not provided by me):</p>

<pre><code>HTML header:  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;
    src=&quot;http://example.net/mathjax/MathJax.js&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<h4 id="quoteslanguage">Quotes Language</h4>

<p>This is used to specify which style of &#8220;smart&#8221; quotes to use in the output document. The available options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>dutch</li>
<li>english</li>
<li>french</li>
<li>german</li>
<li>germanguillemets</li>
<li>swedish</li>
</ul>

<p>The default is <code>english</code> if not specified. This affects HTML output. To
change the language of a document in LaTeX is up to the individual.</p>

<p><code>Quotes Language</code> does not trigger a complete document.</p>

<h4 id="latexfooter">LaTeX Footer</h4>

<p>A special case of the <code>LaTeX Input</code> metadata below. This file will be linked
to at the very end of the document.</p>

<h4 id="latexinput">LaTeX Input</h4>

<p>When outputting a LaTeX document it is necessary to include various directions
that specify how the document should be formatted. These are not included in
the MultiMarkdown document itself &#8212; instead they should be stored separately
and linked to with <code>\input{file}</code> commands.</p>

<p>These links can be included in the metadata section. The metadata is processed
in order, so I generally break my directives into a group that need to go
before my metadata, a group that goes after the metadata but before the
document itself, and a separate group that goes at the end of the document,
for example:</p>

<pre><code>latex input:        mmd-memoir-header
Title:              MultiMarkdown Example
Base Header Level:  2
latex mode:         memoir
latex input:        mmd-memoir-begin-doc
latex footer:       mmd-memoir-footer
</code></pre>

<p>You can download the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown-latex-support">LaTeX Support</a> files if you want to output documents
using the default MultiMarkdown styles. You can then use these as examples to
create your own customized LaTeX output.</p>

<p>This function should allow you to do almost anything you could do using the
XSLT features from MultiMarkdown 2.0. More importantly, it means that advanced
LaTeX users do not have to learn XSLT to customize their code as desired.</p>

<h4 id="latexmode">LaTeX Mode</h4>

<p>When outputting a document to LaTeX, there are two special options that change
the output slightly &#8212; <code>memoir</code> and <code>beamer</code>. These options are designed to
be compatible with the LaTeX classes of the same names.</p>

<h4 id="odfheader">ODF Header</h4>

<p>You can include raw XML to be included in the header of a file output in
OpenDocument format. It&#8217;s up to you to properly format your XML and get it
working &#8212; MultiMarkdown just copies it verbatim to the output.</p>

<h4 id="title">Title</h4>

<p>Self-explanatory.</p>

<h3 id="cross-references">Cross-References</h3>

<p>An oft-requested feature was the ability to have Markdown automatically handle
within-document links as easily as it handled external links. To this aim, I
added the ability to interpret <code>[Some Text][]</code> as a cross-link, if a header
named &#8220;Some Text&#8221; exists.</p>

<p>As an example, <code>[Metadata][]</code> will take you to the
<a href="#metadata">section describing metadata</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can include an optional label of your choosing to help
disambiguate cases where multiple headers have the same title:</p>

<pre><code>### Overview [MultiMarkdownOverview] ##
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to use <code>[MultiMarkdownOverview]</code> to refer to this section
specifically, and not another section named <code>Overview</code>. This works with atx-
or settext-style headers.</p>

<p>If you have already defined an anchor using the same id that is used by a
header, then the defined anchor takes precedence.</p>

<p>In addition to headers within the document, you can provide labels for images
and tables which can then be used for cross-references as well.</p>

<h3 id="imageandlinkattributes">Image and Link Attributes</h3>

<p>Adding attributes to links and images has been requested for a long time on
the Markdown discussion list. I was fairly opposed to this, as most of the
proposals really disrupted the readability of the syntax. I consider myself a
&#8220;Markdown purist&#8221;, meaning that I took John&#8217;s introduction to heart:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The overriding design goal for Markdown&#8217;s formatting syntax is to make
it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted
document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
like it&#8217;s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While
Markdown&#8217;s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML
filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown&#8217;s
syntax is the format of plain text email.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because there was not a syntax proposal that I felt fit this goal, I was generally opposed to the idea.</p>

<p>Then, Choan C. Gálvez <a href="http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2005-October/001578.html">proposed</a> a brilliantly simple syntax that
stayed out of the way. By simply appending the attributes to the link
reference information, which is already removed from the text itself, it
doesn&#8217;t disturb the readability.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>This is a formatted ![image][] and a [link][] with attributes.

[image]: http://path.to/image &quot;Image title&quot; width=40px height=400px
[link]:  http://path.to/link.html &quot;Some Link&quot; class=external
         style=&quot;border: solid black 1px;&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate width and height attributes for the image, and a border
around the link. And while it can be argued that it does look &#8220;like it&#8217;s been
marked up with tags [and] formatting instructions&#8221;, even I can&#8217;t argue too
strongly against it. The link and the title in quotes already look like some
form of markup, and the the additional tags are hardly that intrusive, and
they offer a great deal of functionality. They might even be useful in further
functions (citations?).</p>

<p>The attributes must continue after the other link/image data, and may contain
newlines, but must start at the beginning of the line. The format is
<code>attribute=value</code> or <code>attribute=&quot;multi word value&quot;</code>. Currently, MultiMarkdown
does not attempt to interpret or make any use of any of these attributes.
Also, you can&#8217;t have a multiword attribute span a newline.</p>

<h3 id="tables">Tables</h3>

<p>I have implemented a syntax for tables similar to that used by Michael
Fortin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/">PHP Markdown Extra</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, it allows you to turn:</p>

<pre><code>|             |          Grouping           ||
First Header  | Second Header | Third Header |
 ------------ | :-----------: | -----------: |
Content       |          *Long Cell*        ||
Content       |   **Cell**    |         Cell |

New section   |     More      |         Data |
And more      |            And more          |
[Prototype table]
</code></pre>

<p>into a <a href="#prototypetable">table</a>.</p>

<table>
<caption id="prototypetable">Prototype table</caption>
<colgroup>
<col style="text-align:left;"/>
<col style="text-align:center;"/>
<col style="text-align:right;"/>
</colgroup>

<thead>
<tr>
	<th style="text-align:left;"></th>
	<th style="text-align:center;" colspan="2">Grouping</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<th style="text-align:left;">First Header</th>
	<th style="text-align:center;">Second Header</th>
	<th style="text-align:right;">Third Header</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Content</td>
	<td style="text-align:center;" colspan="2"><em>Long Cell</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">Content</td>
	<td style="text-align:center;"><strong>Cell</strong></td>
	<td style="text-align:right;">Cell</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<tbody>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">New section</td>
	<td style="text-align:center;">More</td>
	<td style="text-align:right;">Data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td style="text-align:left;">And more</td>
	<td style="text-align:center;" colspan="2">And more</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The requirements are:</p>

<ul>
<li>There must be at least one <code>|</code> per line</li>
<li>The second line must contain only <code>|</code>,<code>-</code>,<code>:</code>,<code>.</code>, or spaces</li>
<li>Cell content must be on one line only</li>
<li>Columns are separated by <code>|</code></li>
<li>The first line of the table, and the alignment/divider line, must start at
the beginning of the line</li>
</ul>

<p>Other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is optional whether you have <code>|</code>&#8217;s at the beginning and end of lines.</p></li>
<li><p>To set alignment, you can use a colon to designate left or right alignment,
 or a colon at each end to designate center alignment, as above. If no colon
 is present, the default alignment of your system is selected (left in most
 cases). If you use a period character (<code>.</code>), then <code>char</code> alignment is used -
 in the future this will allow columns of decimal formatted numbers to be
 aligned on the decimal character. Browsers do not currently support this
 feature, so it is somewhat useless at the moment. It could be used in an
 XSLT stylesheet for other output formats (e.g. LaTeX).</p></li>
<li><p>To indicate that a cell should span multiple columns, there simply add
 additional pipes (<code>|</code>) at the end of the cell, as shown in the example. If
 the cell in question is at the end of the row, then of course that means
 that pipes are not optional at the end of that row&#8230;.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use normal Markdown markup within the table cells.</p></li>
<li><p>Captions are optional, but if present must be at the beginning of the line
 immediately preceding or following the table, start with <code>[</code>, and end with
 <code>]</code>. If you have a caption before and after the table, only the first match
 will be used.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a caption, you can also have a label, allowing you to create
 anchors pointing to the table. If there is no label, then the caption acts
 as the label</p></li>
<li><p>Cells can be empty.</p></li>
<li><p>You can create multiple <code>&lt;tbody&gt;</code> tags within a table by having a <strong>single</strong>
 empty line between rows of the table. This allows your CSS to place
 horizontal borders to emphasize different sections of the table.</p></li>
<li><p>If there is no header for the first column, then cells in that column will
 be treated as headers, and formatted as such.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>

<p>I have added support for footnotes to MultiMarkdown, using the syntax proposed
by John Gruber. Note that there is no official support for footnotes yet, so
the output format may change, but the input format sounds fairly stable.</p>

<p>To create a footnote, enter something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>Here is some text containing a footnote.[^somesamplefootnote]

[^somesamplefootnote]: Here is the text of the footnote itself.

[somelink]:http://somelink.com
</code></pre>

<p>The footnote itself must be at the start of a line, just like links by
reference. If you want a footnote to have multiple paragraphs, lists, etc.,
then the subsequent paragraphs need an extra tab preceding them. You may have
to experiment to get this just right, and please let me know of any issues you
find.</p>

<p>This is what the final result looks like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here is some text containing a footnote.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="citations">Citations</h3>

<p>I have included support for <em>basic</em> bibliography features in this version of
MultiMarkdown. Please give me feedback on ways to improve this but keep the
following in mind:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Bibliography support in MultiMarkdown is rudimentary. The goal is to offer
a basic standalone feature, that can be changed using the tool of your choice
to a more robust format (e.g. BibTeX, CiteProc). My XSLT files demonstrate how
to make this format compatible with BibTeX, but I am not planning on
personally providing compatibility with other tools. Feel free to post your
ideas and tools to the wiki.</p></li>
<li><p>Those needing more detailed function sets for their bibliographies may need
customized tools to provide those services. This is a basic tool that should
work for most people. Reference librarians will probably not be satisfied
however.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>To use citations in MultiMarkdown, you use a syntax much like that for
anchors:</p>

<pre><code>This is a statement that should be attributed to
its source[p. 23][#Doe:2006].

And following is the description of the reference to be
used in the bibliography.

[#Doe:2006]: John Doe. *Some Big Fancy Book*.  Vanity Press, 2006.
</code></pre>

<p>The HTML that is generated is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This is a statement that should be attributed to its source
&lt;span class=&quot;markdowncitation&quot;&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;#Doe:2006&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span 
class=&quot;locator&quot;&gt;p. 23&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And following is the description of the reference to be used
in the bibliography.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bibliography&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bibliography&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;Doe:2006&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] John Doe. &lt;em&gt;Some Big Fancy Book&lt;/em&gt;.
Vanity Press, 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You are not required to use a locator (e.g. p. 23), and there are
no special rules on what can be used as a locator if you choose
to use one. If you prefer to omit the locator, just use an empty
set of square brackets before the citation:</p>

<pre><code>This is a statement that should be attributed to its 
source[][#Doe:2006].
</code></pre>

<p>There are no rules on the citation key format that you use (e.g. <code>Doe:2006</code>),
but it must be preceded by a <code>#</code>, just like footnotes use <code>^</code>.</p>

<p>As for the reference description, you can use Markup code within this section,
and I recommend leaving a blank line afterwards to prevent concatenation of
several references. Note that there is no way to reformat these references in
different bibliography styles; for this you need a program designed for that
purpose (e.g. BibTeX).</p>

<p>If you want to include a source in your bibliography that was not cited, you
may use the following:</p>

<pre><code>[Not cited][#citekey]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Not cited</code> bit is not case sensitive.</p>

<p>If you are creating a LaTeX document, the citations will be included, and
natbib will be used by default. If you are not using BibTeX and are getting
errors about your citations not being compatible with &#8216;Author-Year&#8217;, you can
add the following to your documents metadata:</p>

<pre><code>latex input:        mmd-natbib-plain
</code></pre>

<p>This changes the citation style in natbib to avoid these errors, and is useful
when you include your citations in the MultiMarkdown document itself.</p>

<h3 id="bibtex">BibTeX</h3>

<p>If you are creating a LaTeX document, and need a bibliography, then you should
definitely look into <a href="http://www.bibtex.org/">BibTeX</a> and
<a href="http://merkel.zoneo.net/Latex/natbib.php">natbib</a>. It is beyond the scope of
this document to describe how these two packages work, but it is possible to
combine them with MultiMarkdown.</p>

<p>To use BibTeX in a MultiMarkdown document, you need to use the <a href="#bibtex"><code>BibTeX</code>
metadata</a> to specify where your citations are stored.</p>

<p>Since <code>natbib</code> is enabled by default, you have a choice between using the
<code>\citep</code> and <code>\citet</code> commands. The following shows how this relates to the
MultiMarkdown syntax used.</p>

<pre><code>[#citekey]    =&gt; ~\citep{citekey}
[#citekey][]  =&gt; ~\citep{citekey}

[foo][#citekey] =&gt; ~\citep[foo]{citekey}

[foo\]\[bar][#citekey] =&gt; ~\citep[foo][bar]{citekey}


[#citekey;]    =&gt; \citet{citekey}
[#citekey;][]  =&gt; \citet{citekey}

[foo][#citekey;] =&gt; \citet[foo]{citekey}

[foo\]\[bar][#citekey;] =&gt; \citet[foo][bar]{citekey}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="definitionlists">Definition Lists</h3>

<p>MultiMarkdown has support for definition lists using the same syntax used in
<a href="http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/">PHP Markdown Extra</a>. Specifically:</p>

<pre><code>Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
    the family Rosaceae.
:   An american computer company.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.
</code></pre>

<p>becomes:</p>

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Apple
</dt>
<dd>Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in
 the family Rosaceae.</dd>

<dd>An american computer company.</dd>

<dt>Orange
</dt>
<dd>The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.</dd>
</dl>

</blockquote>

<p>You can have more than one term per definition by placing each term on a
separate line. Each definition starts with a colon, and you can have more than
one definition per term. You may optionally have a blank line between the last
term and the first definition.</p>

<p>Definitions may contain other block level elements, such as lists,
blockquotes, or other definition lists.</p>

<p>Unlike PHP Markdown Extra, all definitions are wrapped in <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags. First, I
was unable to get Markdown <em>not</em> to create paragraphs. Second, I didn&#8217;t see
where it mattered - the only difference seems to be aesthetic, and I actually
prefer the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags in place. Let me know if this is a problem.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://www.michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/">PHP Markdown Extra</a> page for more information.</p>

<h3 id="math">Math</h3>

<p>MultiMarkdown 2.0 used <a href="http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html">ASCIIMathML</a> to typeset mathematical equations. There
were benefits to using ASCIIMathML, but also some disadvantages.</p>

<p>When rewriting for MultiMarkdown 3.0, there was no straightforward way to
implement ASCIIMathML which lead me to look for alternatives. I settled on
using <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>. The advantage here is that the same syntax is supported by
MathJax in browsers, and in LaTeX. </p>

<p>This does mean that math will need to be entered into MultiMarkdown documents
using the LaTeX syntax, rather than ASCIIMathML.</p>

<p>To enable MathJax support in web pages, you have to include a link to an
active MathJax installation &#8212; setting this up is beyond the scope of this
document, but it&#8217;s not too hard.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example of the metadata setup, and some math:</p>

<pre><code>latex input:    mmd-article-header  
Title:          MultiMarkdown Math Example  
latex input:    mmd-article-begin-doc  
latex footer:   mmd-memoir-footer  
HTML header:    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;
    src=&quot;http://example.net/mathjax/MathJax.js&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;


An example of math within a paragraph --- \\({e}^{i\pi }+1=0\\)
--- easy enough.

And an equation on it's own:

\\[ {x}_{1,2}=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{{b}^{2}-4ac}}{2a} \\]

That's it.
</code></pre>

<p>Here&#8217;s what it looks like in action (if you&#8217;re viewing this document in a
supported format):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An example of math within a paragraph &#8212; <span class="math">\({e}^{i\pi }+1=0\)</span>
&#8212; easy enough.</p>

<p>And an equation on it&#8217;s own:</p>

<p><span class="math">\[ {x}_{1,2}=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{{b}^{2}-4ac}}{2a} \]</span></p>

<p>That&#8217;s it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="glossary">Glossary</h3>

<p>MultiMarkdown has a feature that allows footnotes to be specified as glossary
terms. It doesn&#8217;t do much for XHTML documents, but the XSLT file that converts
the document into LaTeX is designed to convert these special footnotes into
glossary entries.</p>

<p>The glossary format for the footnotes is:</p>

<pre><code>[^glossaryfootnote]: glossary: term (optional sort key)
    The actual definition belongs on a new line, and can continue on
    just as other footnotes.
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>term</code> is the item that belongs in the glossary. The <code>sort key</code> is
optional, and is used to specify that the term should appear somewhere else in
the glossary (which is sorted in alphabetical order).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it takes an extra step to generate the glossary when creating a
pdf from a latex file:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You need to have the <code>basic.gst</code> file installed, which comes with the
memoir class.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to run a special makeindex command to generate the <code>.glo</code> file:
 <code>makeindex -s `kpsewhich basic.gst` -o &quot;filename.gls&quot; &quot;filename.glo&quot;</code></p></li>
<li><p>Then you run the usual pdflatex command again a few times.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the code below to create an engine file for TeXShop
(it belongs in <code>~/Library/TeXShop/Engines</code>). You can name it something like
<code>MemoirGlossary.engine</code>. Then, when processing a file that needs a glossary,
you typeset your document once with this engine, and then continue to process
it normally with the usual LaTeX engine. Your glossary should be compiled
appropriately. If you use <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/" title="TeXShop Homepage">TeXShop</a>, this is the way to go.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>Getting glossaries to work is a slightly more advanced LaTeX
feature, and might take some trial and error the first few times.</em></p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/ 

set path = ($path /usr/local/teTeX/bin/powerpc-apple-darwin-current 
    /usr/local/bin) # This is actually a continuation of the line above

set basefile = `basename &quot;$1&quot; .tex`

makeindex -s `kpsewhich basic.gst` -o &quot;${basefile}.gls&quot; &quot;${basefile}.glo&quot;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="rawhtml">Raw HTML</h3>

<p>You can include raw (X)HTML within your document. Exactly what happens with
these portions depends on the output format. You can also use the <code>markdown</code>
attribute to indicate that MultiMarkdown processing should be applied within
the block level HTML tag. This is in addition to the <code>--process-html</code> command
line option that causes MultiMarkdown processing to occur within <em>all</em> block
level HTML tags.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;This is *not* MultiMarkdown&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div markdown=1&gt;This *is* MultiMarkdown&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>will produce the following without <code>--process-html</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;This is *not* MultiMarkdown&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;This &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; MultiMarkdown&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and with <code>--process-html</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; MultiMarkdown&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;This &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; MultiMarkdown&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, the results may be different than anticipated when outputting to
LaTeX or other formats. Normally, block level HTML will be ignored when
outputting to LaTeX or ODF. The example above would produce the following,
leaving out the first <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> entirely:</p>

<pre><code>This \emph{is} MultiMarkdown
</code></pre>

<p>And this with <code>--process-html</code>:</p>

<pre><code>This is \emph{not} MultiMarkdown
This \emph{is} MultiMarkdown
</code></pre>

<p>You will also notice that the line breaks are different when outputting to
LaTeX or ODF, and this can cause the contents of two <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags to be placed
into a single paragraph.</p>

<h2 id="howdoicustomizemultimarkdownoutput">How do I customize MultiMarkdown Output?</h2>

<p>By default, I believe MultiMarkdown does a good job with the default output
for the various output formats. That said, it is often desirable to customize
the output to your specific needs.</p>

<h3 id="htmlcustomization">HTML Customization</h3>

<p>The easiest way to customize HTML output is to apply style information using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a>. You can do this by linking to a CSS
file with the <a href="#css"><code>CSS</code> metadata</a>, or by manually including style
information in the form of the <a href="#htmlheader"><code>HTML Header</code> metadata</a>.</p>

<p>A more advanced approach is to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a> to post-process the HTML output and
customize it. You can also write scripts in whatever language you are most
familiar with to process the output as desired. You can include these
functions in your workflow in whatever method works best for you.</p>

<h3 id="latexcustomization">LaTeX Customization</h3>

<p>Similarly, you can customize the appearance of your LaTeX output when using
MultiMarkdown. The most straightforward way is through the use of <a href="#latexinput"><code>LaTeX
Input</code> metadata</a>. You can include whatever valid LaTeX code in
these files that you desire, and you are limited only by your creativity. You
can redefine common commands as needed. You can include various packages, or
add default metadata. I recommend examining the samples in the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-Gallery">MultiMarkdown
Gallery</a> to see some of the customizations I have used so far.</p>

<p>In addition to customizing the output, there are several different &#8220;modes&#8221; of
operation when MultiMarkdown outputs LaTeX. These modes can create various
types of documents and rely on common packages. These modes can be specified with the <a href="#latexmode"><code>LaTeX Mode</code> metadata</a>.</p>

<h4 id="defaultlatexmode">Default LaTeX Mode</h4>

<p>The default mode of operation outputs fairly standard LaTeX that should be
compatible with most basic document types and packages.</p>

<h4 id="memoirlatexmode">Memoir LaTeX Mode</h4>

<p>The <code>memoir</code> mode generates output designed to be compatible with the <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/memoir/">memoir
package</a>. This package offers several advantages, and can be used to create
books, reports, and other basic document formats.</p>

<p>By default, this User&#8217;s Guide is processed into a PDF using the memoir class.</p>

<h4 id="beamerlatexmode">Beamer LaTeX Mode</h4>

<p>The <code>beamer</code> mode generates output designed to be compatible with the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/wiki/Home">beamer
package</a>. This package allows you to easily create PDF slideshows (similar to
Apple&#8217;s Keynote or Microsoft&#8217;s PowerPoint). I used it to create the &#8220;What is
MultiMarkdown?&#8221; <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-Gallery/raw/master/What-Is-MMD/what_is_mmd.pdf">slideshow</a>.</p>

<h3 id="opmlcustomization">OPML Customization</h3>

<p>There really isn&#8217;t anything to customize when creating an OPML document, since
it&#8217;s really just a different way of formatting a MultiMarkdown text document.</p>

<h3 id="opendocumentcustomization">OpenDocument Customization</h3>

<p>OpenDocument files use style information in a way that&#8217;s similar to CSS for
HTML. To embed custom style information, you can use the <a href="#odfheader"><code>ODF Header</code>
metadata</a>. This will embed your XML into the header of the
document. You&#8217;ll have to figure out the syntax of what to include on your own,
but it&#8217;s not too difficult if you examine the source of the documents you are
interested in emulating.</p>

<p>Since the OpenDocument Flat Text file is an XML file, you could also use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">XSLT</a> to customize the file as desired.</p>

<h3 id="tipsandtricks">Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>There are some creative ways to tailor the output you get based on which
format type you are exporting, particularly with HTML and LaTeX. These tricks
make use of <a href="#multimarkdownandlatex">raw LaTeX</a>, and <a href="#rawhtml">raw HTML</a>.</p>

<p>Experiment and you can come up with some creative things!</p>

<h2 id="multimarkdownoutputformats">MultiMarkdown Output Formats</h2>

<p>MultiMarkdown can output to various formats. The default behavior for each
format should be pretty good, but each format does have it&#8217;s own unique
characteristics that sometimes need adjustment.</p>

<h3 id="html">HTML</h3>

<p>HTML is the &#8220;default&#8221; format for outputting MultiMarkdown documents, so it&#8217;s
behavior is generally the most predictable.</p>

<h3 id="latex">LaTeX</h3>

<p>LaTeX is the second oldest output format for MultiMarkdown, so many issues
have been worked out.</p>

<h3 id="opendocument">OpenDocument</h3>

<p>OpenDocument Text, or more specifically Flat XML or <code>.fodt</code>, is a newer format
for MultiMarkdown, so there may still be a few kinks to be worked out.</p>

<h4 id="images">Images</h4>

<p>When outputting to OpenDocument, images are &#8220;linked&#8221; to in much the same way
as when creating HTML. The images are not actually embedded in the document
itself by default. This means, that if you wanted to share the document with
someone else, you would also have to share the images.</p>

<p>The advantage is that the images will automatically be updated if the original
is changed.</p>

<p>If you want to embed the images into the document, then you can use the
<code>Edit:Links:Break Link</code> menu item (or something similar depending on your
application) to embed each image as desired.</p>

<h4 id="imagesize">Image size</h4>

<p>Images work best in OpenDocument when both a height and width attribute are
specified. If only a width or height is specified, then things will work, but
the image might not look correct. If you specify a dimension as a percentage,
you may have to manually adjust the image to fit the guidelines provided in
the document.</p>

<h3 id="opml">OPML</h3>

<p>OPML, or Outline Processor Markup Language, is a basic format that is useful
for importing and exporting from various outlining programs (e.g
<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnioutliner/">OmniOutliner</a>). When
used with MultiMarkdown, you can switch back and forth from an outliner and
text editor as necessary to work on a document. The text editor will likely be
easier for writing your prose, and the outliner may be easier when rearranging
the structure of your document.</p>

<h4 id="irregularhierarchyissues">&#8220;Irregular&#8221; hierarchy issues</h4>

<p>When using an Outliner, each level in the document (e.g. <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, etc.) is
a child of a parent that is one level &#8220;higher&#8221; than the child. For example:</p>

<pre><code>## Second Level ##

### Third level ###

This is a child of the level 2 parent, &quot;Second Level&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>It causes problems if you were to try and &#8220;skip&#8221; a level:</p>

<pre><code>## Second Level ##

#### Fourth level ####

This is *not* a child of the level 2 parent, &quot;Second Level&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>If you use <code>multimarkdown</code> to process a text file containing such &#8220;skips&#8221; into
an OPML, any &#8220;orphaned&#8221; levels will not be included in the output. This can be
seen as a feature, or a limitation depending on your needs.</p>

<h2 id="whatsdifferentinmultimarkdown3.0">What&#8217;s different in MultiMarkdown 3.0?</h2>

<h3 id="whycreateanotherversionofmultimarkdown">Why create another version of MultiMarkdown?</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Maintaining a growing collection of nested regular expressions was going to
 become increasingly difficult. I don&#8217;t plan on adding much (if any) in the
 way of new syntax features, but it was a mess.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance on longer documents was poor. The nested perl regular
 expressions was slow, even on a relatively fast computer. Performance on
 something like an iPhone would probably have been miserable.</p></li>
<li><p>The reliance on Perl made installation fairly complex on Windows. That
 didn&#8217;t bother me too much, but it is a factor.</p></li>
<li><p>Perl can&#8217;t be run on an iPhone/iPad, and I would like to be able to have
 MultiMarkdown on an iOS device, and not just regular Markdown (which exists
 in C versions).</p></li>
<li><p>I was interested in learning about PEG&#8217;s and revisiting C programming.</p></li>
<li><p>The syntax has been fairly stable, and it would be nice to be able to
 formalize it a bit &#8212; which happens by definition when using a PEG.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to revisit the syntax and features and clean things up a bit.</p></li>
<li><p>Did I mention how much faster this is? And that it could (eventually) run on
 an iPhone?</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="completedocumentsvs.snippets">&#8220;Complete&#8221; documents vs. &#8220;snippets&#8221;</h3>

<p>A &#8220;snippet&#8221; is a section of HTML (or LaTeX) that is not a complete,
fully-formed document. It doesn&#8217;t contain the header information to make it a
valid XML document. It can&#8217;t be compiled with LaTeX into a PDF without further
commands.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code># This is a header #

And a paragraph.
</code></pre>

<p>becomes the following HTML snippet:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1 id=&quot;thisisaheader&quot;&gt;This is a header&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and the following LaTeX snippet:</p>

<pre><code>\part{This is a header}
\label{thisisaheader}


And a paragraph.
</code></pre>

<p>It was not possible to create a LaTeX snippet with the original MultiMarkdown,
because it relied on having a complete XHTML document that was then converted
to LaTeX via an XSLT document (requiring a whole separate program). This was
powerful, but complicated.</p>

<p>Now, I have come full-circle. peg-multimarkdown will now output LaTeX
directly, without requiring XSLT. This allows the creation of LaTeX snippets,
or complete documents, as necessary.</p>

<p>To create a complete document, simply include metadata. You can include a
title, author, date, or whatever you like. If you don&#8217;t want to include any
real metadata, including &#8220;format: complete&#8221; will still trigger a complete
document, just like it used to.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If the <em>only</em> metadata present is <code>Base Header Level</code> then a
complete document will not be triggered. This can be useful when combining
various documents together.</p>

<p>The old approach (even though it was hidden from most users) was a bit of a
kludge, and this should be more elegant, and more flexible.</p>

<h3 id="metadatadifferences">Metadata Differences</h3>

<p>When metadata was repeated in MultiMarkdown 2.0, the second instance
&#8220;overwrote&#8221; the first instance. In MultiMarkdown 3.0, each instance of a
repeated metadata key is used. This is necessary for something like <code>LaTeX
Input</code> which can require multiple instances.</p>

<p>This means you can&#8217;t &#8220;erase&#8221; an unnecessary metadata value by including a
second, empty, copy. This was a trick used, for example, to erase undesired
style information inserted into the document by older versions of Scrivener.</p>

<h3 id="creatinglatexdocuments">Creating LaTeX Documents</h3>

<p>LaTeX documents are created a bit differently than under the old system. You
no longer have to use an XSLT file to convert from XHTML to LaTeX. You can go
straight from MultiMarkdown to LaTeX, which is faster and more flexible.</p>

<p>To create a complete LaTeX document, you can process your file as a snippet,
and then place it in a LaTeX template that you already have. Alternatively,
you can use metadata to trigger the creation of a complete document. You can
use the <code>LaTeX Input</code> metadata to insert a <code>\input{file}</code> command. You can
then store various template files in your texmf directory and call them with
metadata, or with embedded raw LaTeX commands in your document. For example:</p>

<pre><code>LaTeX Input:        mmd-memoir-header  
Title:              Sample MultiMarkdown Document  
Author:             Fletcher T. Penney  
LaTeX Mode:         memoir  
LaTeX Input:        mmd-memoir-begin-doc  
LaTeX Footer:       mmd-memoir-footer  
</code></pre>

<p>This would include several template files in the order that you see. The
<code>LaTeX Footer</code> metadata inserts a template at the end of your document. Note
that the order and placement of the <code>LaTeX Include</code> statements is important.</p>

<p>The <code>LaTeX Mode</code> metadata allows you to specify that MultiMarkdown should use
the <code>memoir</code> or <code>beamer</code> output format. This places subtle differences in the
output document for compatibility with those respective classes.</p>

<p>This system isn&#8217;t quite as powerful as the XSLT approach, since it doesn&#8217;t
alter the actual MultiMarkdown to LaTeX conversion process. But it is probably
much more familiar to LaTeX users who are accustomed to using <code>\input{}</code>
commands and doesn&#8217;t require knowledge of XSLT programming.</p>

<p>I recommend checking out the default <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown-latex-support">LaTeX Support Files</a> that are available
on github. They are designed to serve as a starting point for your own needs.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can still use this version of MultiMarkdown to convert text into
XHTML, and then process the XHTML using XSLT to create a LaTeX document, just
like you used to in MMD 2.0.</p>

<h3 id="images">Images</h3>

<p>In HTML, images have three pieces of &#8220;metadata&#8221; relevant to MMD &#8212; <code>alt</code>,
<code>title</code>, and <code>id</code>. In Markdown and MultiMarkdown 2.0, these were structured in
the following manner:</p>

<pre><code>This is an image ![alt text](file.png &quot;This is a title&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>In MultiMarkdown 2.0, the &#8220;alt text&#8221; was processed to &#8220;alttext&#8221; and used as an
<code>id</code> attribute.</p>

<p>The problem was that LaTeX, and later on ODF, didn&#8217;t really need the <code>alt</code> or
<code>title</code> metadata &#8212; those formats really needed a <em>caption</em> instead. Using a
caption in some formats, but not others, leads to strange inconsistencies in
the documents created from the same MultiMarkdown source. And while I
understand the differences between the <code>alt</code> and <code>title</code> attributes, it really
doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>So instead, in MultiMarkdown 3.0, the following is used instead:</p>

<pre><code>This is an image ![This is alt text](file.png &quot;This is a title&quot;)

or

This is an image ![Another *alt*][fig]

![This is a *caption*][fig2]

The following image has no `alt` or `caption`:

![][fig2]

[fig]: file2.png &quot;This is another title&quot;
[fig2]: file3.png &quot;This is another title&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>id</code> attribute comes into play when an image is specified as a reference.
This allows you to link to the image from elsewhere in your document.</p>

<p>When an image is the only thing constituting a paragraph, it is becomes
wrapped in a <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> tag, and instead of an <code>alt</code> attribute, it has a
caption. This is demonstrated by <code>fig2</code> above. This caption is used regardless
of output format, providing consistency between HTML, LaTeX, and ODF. When
this happens, the alt tag is a stripped down version of the caption, since it
can&#8217;t have any markup applied.</p>

<p>So, in MultiMarkdown 3.0, there are now 4 pieces of metadata &#8212; <code>alt</code>,
<code>title</code>, <code>id</code>, and an optional <code>caption</code>. There are only three places to
describe this metadata, so one piece has to be duplicated. Currently, the
<code>alt</code> is a duplicate of the <code>caption</code>, sans any markup. If an image is
contained within a paragraph, an <code>alt</code> attribute is created, but no <code>caption</code>.</p>

<p>An alternative plan I am considering is to use what currently generates the
<code>title</code> attribute to instead generate the <code>alt</code> attribute in all instances,
and the caption can be ignored if an image is not considered a figure.</p>

<h3 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h3>

<p>Footnotes work slightly differently than before. This is partially on purpose,
and partly out of necessity. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Footnotes are anchored based on number, rather than the label used in the
 MMD source. This won&#8217;t show a visible difference to the reader, but the
 XHTML source will be different.</p></li>
<li><p>Footnotes can be used more than once. Each reference will link to the same
 numbered note, but the &#8220;return&#8221; link will only link to the first instance.</p></li>
<li><p>Footnote &#8220;return&#8221; links are a separate paragraph after the footnote. This is
 due to the way peg-markdown works, and it&#8217;s not worth the effort to me to
 change it. You can always use CSS to change the appearance however you like.</p></li>
<li><p>Footnote numbers are surrounded by &#8220;[]&#8221; in the text.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rawhtml">Raw HTML</h3>

<p>Because the original MultiMarkdown processed the text document into XHTML
first, and then processed the entire XHTML document into LaTeX, it couldn&#8217;t
tell the difference between raw HTML and HTML that was created from plaintext.
This version, however, uses the original plain text to create the LaTeX
document. This means that any raw HTML inside your MultiMarkdown document is
<strong>not</strong> converted into LaTeX.</p>

<p>The benefit of this is that you can embed one piece of the document in two
formats &#8212; one for XHTML, and one for LaTeX:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Release early, release often!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linus Torvalds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- \epigraph{Release early, release often!}{Linus Torvalds} --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In this section, when the document is converted into XHTML, the <code>blockquote</code>
sections will be used as expected, and the <code>epigraph</code> will be ignored since it
is inside a comment. Conversely, when processed into LaTeX, the raw HTML will
be ignored, and the comment will be processed as raw LaTeX.</p>

<p>You shouldn&#8217;t need to use this feature, but if you want to specify exactly how
a certain part of your document is processed into LaTeX, it&#8217;s a neat trick.</p>

<h3 id="mathsupport">Math Support</h3>

<p>MultiMarkdown 2.0 supported <a href="http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html">ASCIIMathML</a> embedded with MultiMarkdown
documents. This syntax was then converted to MathML for XHTML output, and then
further processed into LaTeX when creating LaTeX output. The benefit of this
was that the ASCIIMathML syntax was pretty straightforward. The downside was
that only a handful of browsers actually support MathML, so most of the time
it was only useful for LaTeX. Many MMD users who are interested in LaTeX
output already knew LaTeX, so they sometimes preferred native math syntax,
which led to several hacks.</p>

<p>MultiMarkdown 3.0 does not have built in support for ASCIIMathML. In fact, I
would probably have to write a parser from scratch to do anything useful with
it, which I have little desire to do. So I came up with a compromise.</p>

<p>ASCIIMathML is no longer supported by MultiMarkdown. Instead, you <em>can</em> use
LaTeX to code for math within your document. When creating a LaTeX document,
the source is simply passed through, and LaTeX handles it as usual. <em>If</em> you
desire, you can add a line to your header when creating XHTML documents that
will allow <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> to appropriately display your math.</p>

<p>Normally, MathJax <em>and</em> LaTeX supported using <code>\[ math \]</code> or <code>\( math \)</code> to
indicate that math was included. MMD stumbled on this due to some issues with
escaping, so instead we use <code>\\[ math \\]</code> and <code>\\( math \\)</code>. See an
example:</p>

<pre><code>latex input:    mmd-article-header  
Title:          MultiMarkdown Math Example  
latex input:    mmd-article-begin-doc  
latex footer:   mmd-memoir-footer  
xhtml header:   &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;
    src=&quot;http://localhost/~fletcher/math/mathjax/MathJax.js&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;


An example of math within a paragraph --- \\({e}^{i\pi }+1=0\\)
--- easy enough.

And an equation on it's own:

\\[ {x}_{1,2}=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{{b}^{2}-4ac}}{2a} \\]

That's it.
</code></pre>

<p>You would, of course, need to change the <code>xhtml header</code> metadata to point to
your own installation of MathJax.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: MultiMarkdown doesn&#8217;t actually <em>do</em> anything with the code inside
the brackets. It simply strips away the extra backslash and passes the LaTeX
source unchanged, where it is handled by MathJax <em>if</em> it&#8217;s properly installed,
or by LaTeX. If you&#8217;re having trouble, you can certainly email the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/multimarkdown/">MultiMarkdown Discussion List</a>, but I do not provide support for LaTeX code.</p>

<h2 id="knownissues">Known Issues</h2>

<h3 id="non-asciicharactersrequirecompletehtmldocument">Non-ASCII characters require complete HTML document</h3>

<p>In order for Non-ASCII characters to display properly in most browsers, there
needs to be some indication of the character set being used. Without getting
into too many technical details, the easiest way to get HTML output to
display properly is to include metadata that will trigger a complete document,
e.g. a <code>Title</code>.</p>

<h3 id="opendocumentdoesntproperlysupportimagedimensions">OpenDocument doesn&#8217;t properly support image dimensions</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s relatively easy to insert an image into ODF using fixed dimensions, but
harder to get a scaled image without knowing the exact aspect ratio of the
image.</p>

<p>For example, in LaTeX or HTML, one can specify that image should be scaled to
50% of the width, and have it automatically calculate the proper height. This
does not work in ODF, at least not that I can find.</p>

<p>You have to manually adjust the image to fit your desired constraint. It&#8217;s
easy to do, simply hold down the shift key while adjusting the image size, and
it will likely snap to match the specified dimension.</p>

<p>I welcome suggestions on a better way to do this.</p>

<h3 id="mathsupportlackinginopendocument">Math Support lacking in OpenDocument</h3>

<p>I figured out how to embed MathML in an OpenDocument file. There are several
tools to convert LaTeX to MathML, including blahtex.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll probably start by writing a perl utility that can take a MMD-created ODF,
and then parse the math &#8220;bits&#8221; out and put them back in as MathML.</p>

<p>Even better would be if I could figure out how to compile blahtex into
multimarkdown as a library to do the processing internally&#8230;. Not sure how
long that will take to get around to. Anyone with any particular skills in
that area who wants to help - let me know!</p>

<h3 id="bibliographysupportlackinginopendocument">Bibliography support lacking in OpenDocument</h3>

<p>There is no automatic processing of citations when creating an OpenDocument
file. Suggestions are welcome, as I would like to come up with a reasonable
solution, if possible.</p>

<h3 id="opmldoesnthandleskippedlevels">OPML doesn&#8217;t handle &#8220;skipped&#8221; levels</h3>

<p>When converting a MMD text file to OPML with the mmd binary, each level only
contains it&#8217;s direct children. For example:</p>

<pre><code># First Level #

## Second Level  ##

### Third Level ###

## Another Second Level ##

#### Fourth Level ####
</code></pre>

<p>When this is converted to OPML, the &#8220;Fourth Level&#8221; item will be deleted, since it skips a level from its parent, &#8220;Another Second Level&#8221;.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s possible to fix this, but it&#8217;s going to take a more complicated algorithm than what I currently have and it&#8217;s not a high priority for me to fix at the moment.</p>

<p>As always, suggestions welcome.</p>

<h4 id="whenitrytoconverttohtmlmydocumentendsupinthemetadata">When I try to convert to HTML, my document ends up in the metadata</h4>

<p>You are using an automated tool to create &#8220;complete&#8221; content. The tool is
adding the <code>format: complete</code> metadata for you, but you don&#8217;t have any other
metadata in your document.</p>

<p>Start your document with a blank line to indicate that there is no more
metadata.</p>

<p>This should only happen with tools designed for MultiMarkdown 2.0</p>

<h4 id="unicode">Why don&#8217;t non-ASCII characters display properly?</h4>

<p>In order to display non-ASCII characters, a &#8220;complete&#8221; HTML document is
necessary &#8212; a &#8220;snippet&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work. Simply include some metadata to force
complete document generation.</p>

<p>This is true for the QuickLook Generators as well.</p>

<h3 id="latexfaq">LaTeX FAQ</h3>

<h4 id="process-latex">What is LaTeX and how do I use it?</h4>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> is a syntax for describing how to
convert marked up plain text into high-quality, typeset documents.
MultiMarkdown uses LaTeX to generate PDF&#8217;s from your MMD document.</p>

<p>Of note, MultiMarkdown does not process LaTeX files for you. It generates
them, and relies on you to convert the LaTeX into a PDF. The exact commands
you need may vary, but I use the following sequence in my helper script to
include all the features I use.</p>

<pre><code>latexmk file.tex            # This command will do most of the work
makeglossaries file.tex     # process glossary entries if they exist
pdflatex file.tex           # I found that sometimes an extra run
pdflatex file.tex           # or two is needed
latexmk -c file.tex         # clean up a bunch of the temp files
</code></pre>

<h4 id="raw">How can I use raw LaTeX (or other code) with MultiMarkdown?</h4>

<p>Anything placed in an HTML comment will be passed along unaltered - this can
include raw LaTeX code. For example:</p>

<pre><code>This is raw LaTeX: &lt;!-- e^{i \cdot \pi} = -1 --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>will generate:</p>

<pre><code>This is raw LaTeX: e^{i \cdot \pi} = -1 
</code></pre>

<p>See the section on <a href="#multimarkdownandlatex">MultiMarkdown and LaTeX</a> for more information.</p>

<h4 id="latexwontcompile">My LaTeX won&#8217;t compile &#8212; what&#8217;s wrong?</h4>

<p>First - the vast majority of the time, this is not really a MMD problem, but
rather a LaTeX problem, or (honestly) user error. Very occasionally, there are
instances where MMD produces invalid LaTeX output when given unusual input,
but these are rare.</p>

<p>Check to make sure you have proper metadata configured to allow your LaTeX to
compile. See sample documents from the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-Gallery">MultiMarkdown Gallery</a> for some
examples of what metadata is required for various document types/</p>

<p>If you are having problems with a more &#8220;complicated&#8221; MMD tool (such as the
TextMate bundle, or the Drag and Drop versions), use the command line approach
when you are really having difficulties. See if your document will compile to
HTML using the <code>multimarkdown</code> command. Once you&#8217;ve got that working, try
moving on to LaTeX, and then a PDF (if that&#8217;s your goal).</p>

<p>If that doesn&#8217;t work, you need to track down the source of the error. The best
approach is similar to the old program Conflict Catcher. Keep dividing your
document into halves, and test each half. One half will likely compile without
complaint, and the other won&#8217;t. Take the problem half, and repeat this process
until you are able to find the paragraph, sentence, word that causes the
error.</p>

<p>Using a real text editor (e.g. <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>), examine
the trouble section and make sure to view the invisible characters, and look
for something odd. If you can&#8217;t do that, you can also delete the faulty
sentence and retype it (<em>don&#8217;t</em> copy and paste &#8212; you&#8217;ll simply replicate the
problem).</p>

<p>If none of that fixes your problem, post the problem section to the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/multimarkdown">MultiMarkdown Discussion List</a>
and you will likely find out what you&#8217;re doing wrong. Or perhaps you found an
error and I will fix it. ;)</p>

<h4 id="mate-pdf">TextMate won&#8217;t produce a PDF</h4>

<p>MultiMarkdown 2.0 included a command to create a PDF &#8220;automagically&#8221; from a
MultiMarkdown file. This led to a lot of confusion and questions from users
who didn&#8217;t understand what was going (e.g. that MMD creates a LaTeX file, and
that pdflatex then creates the PDF).</p>

<p>MultiMarkdown 3.0 does not <em>officially</em> support the creation of a PDF. It
supports the creation of a <em>LaTeX</em> file. You are then responsible for creating
the PDF.</p>

<p>That said, there is a script <code>mmd2pdf</code> that runs some of those commands for
you. If you have trouble with it, you&#8217;re on your own. Try running the
appropriate LaTeX commands in the Terminal by hand to create your PDF.</p>

<h4 id="howdoisplitamultimarkdowndocumentintoseveralparts">How do I split a MultiMarkdown document into several parts?</h4>

<p>MultiMarkdown is designed to process a single document at a time, but
sometimes it can be useful to split a longer document into multiple parts. For
example, this User&#8217;s Guide is split into multiple pages on a wiki, and then
combined for processing with MultiMarkdown.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/MMD-Support">MMD-Support</a> package, there
is a utility script <code>mmd_merge</code> that can stitch multiple text files together.
It reads an input file that describes which files need to be combined, in what
order, and at what &#8220;level&#8221;. This allows you to ensure that header levels are
adjusted appropriately when the document is combined.</p>

<p>For example, the <code>index.txt</code> file used to combine this User&#8217;s Guide is:</p>

<pre><code># User's guide #

metadata.txt

</code></pre>

<p>As you see above, I use a separate text file for storing metadata. Lines that
begin with <code>#</code> are considered comments.</p>

<p>If you want to indicate that a certain file should have it&#8217;s header levels
increased, you can insert one or more tab characters before the filename. This
is analogous to changing the <code>Base Header Level</code> metadata for that file.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: <code>mmd_merge</code> is a Perl script, so it requires that you have Perl
installed in order to use it.</p>

<h4 id="howdoilinktoanimage">How do I link to an image?</h4>

<p>If you want to link to an image included in your document, you should define
the image using the reference syntax:</p>

<pre><code>This is an image ![Alt Text][image label].

[image label]: /path/to/image.png &quot;This is a title&quot;

And now a link the desired [image](#imagelabel).
</code></pre>

<h4 id="referenceidsdontworkwithhyphens">Reference id&#8217;s don&#8217;t work with hyphens</h4>

<p>Without getting too technical, you have to be careful when including multiple
hyphens and specifying links or images by reference.</p>

<pre><code>This is an ![image-1].

This is the same image, but looks different --- ![image--1].

This is a different image ![image---1].

[image-1]: file.png     &quot;This is used&quot;
[image--1]: file2.png   &quot;This is ignored&quot;
[image---1]: file3.png  &quot;This is used&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>This is because <code>-</code> and <code>--</code> are both converted to <code>en-dash</code>, whereas <code>---</code> is
an <code>em-dash</code>.</p>

<p>Please see <a href="#howdoiinstallmultimarkdown">How do I install MultiMarkdown?</a>.</p>

<h4 id="howcanibetterlearnthemultimarkdownsyntax">How can I better learn the MultiMarkdown Syntax?</h4>

<p>The syntax of MultiMarkdown can be a challenge for beginners especially when
it comes to using Table and Link syntax. The challenge comes in understanding
how it looks <em>after</em> the conversion.</p>

<p>For Mac users, you can download a free program NValt
(<a href="http://brettterpstra.com/code/">http://brettterpstra.com/code/</a>) that contains a preview mode. Thus, you can
enter your markdown with a dynamic preview window to show how the formatting
appears. I&#8217;ve found this useful until I was comfortable with the syntax.</p>

<p>Note also that MultiMarkdown can also be installed to MarsEdit
(<a href="http://red-sweater.com/marsedit/">http://red-sweater.com/marsedit/</a>) which also has a preview mode. This is
even more effective for for bloggers as it will handle inline image upload to
most popular blog software and display the interpreted output of your MMD
syntax.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in web based learning, you may want to try
<a href="http://peg.gd/">http://peg.gd/</a> which provides a web site for writing in Markdown syntax and
display. You can also save the pages for forwarding to other people.</p>

<p>For the reverse requirement, you can visit <a href="http://heckyesmarkdown.com/">http://heckyesmarkdown.com/</a> which
will attempt to take a given HTML Page and convert it into Markdown, usually
with good accuracy.</p>

<h4 id="caniusemultimarkdownonaniphoneipad">Can I use MultiMarkdown on an iPhone/iPad?</h4>

<p>There are a number of programs available for use on the iPhone and iPad that
support regular Markdown, but not MultiMarkdown (yet!).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/">Elements</a> is a iPhone / iPad app
that also has a markdown preview mode. Second Gear has also made
<a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/markdownmail/">MarkdownMail</a> which is
simpler, but also very usable for learning Markdown.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.textasticapp.com/">Textastic</a> is a syntax highlighting text editor
for the iPad that includes a preview mode for Markdown. It will even preview
MathJax equations if you include the proper metadata and a working MathJax
installation!</p>

<p>Now that MultiMarkdown is available in C (as of version 3.0), I would like to
work on modifying it to work with iOS.</p>

<h4 id="howdoitroubleshootanerror">How do I troubleshoot an error?</h4>

<p>First, check some basics:</p>

<ul>
<li>are you using MultiMarkdown 2.0, or 3.0?</li>
<li>are you using the latest release of your version?</li>
<li>if you are using an application (Scrivener, TextMate, etc) does
 MultiMarkdown work from the command line?</li>
<li>if you&#8217;re using LaTeX, did you install the proper support files?</li>
<li>did you read the User&#8217;s Manual? (Yes &#8212; I hate manuals too, but some
 aspects of MultiMarkdown can be rather complex, and that&#8217;s where most
 questions come up)</li>
<li>is this a known issue on <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/issues">github</a>, or the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/multimarkdown/">discussion
 list</a>?</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&#8217;re still having a problem, you first have to figure out what sort of
error you&#8217;re having:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The source document crashes multimarkdown &#8212; this is <em>very</em> rare and can be
 confirmed by trying to convert text to HTML. Use the &#8220;<a href="#divideandconquer">Divide and Conquer</a>&#8221;
 approach to find the problem portion of the document and send it to the
 discussion list.</p></li>
<li><p>You successfully generate LaTeX, but can&#8217;t compile it &#8212; see the section on
 troubleshooting <a href="#latexwontcompile">LaTeX</a> above.</p></li>
<li><p>You successfully generate a document, but it won&#8217;t open properly (this
 generally happens with OpenDocument, but could be other formats) &#8212; use the
 &#8220;<a href="#divideandconquer">Divide and Conquer</a>&#8221; approach to find the problem portion, and send it to
 the discussion list.</p></li>
<li><p>The output you get doesn&#8217;t match what you were expecting &#8212; read the
 pertinent section of the manual, and compare your results against some of
 the sample documents. Make sure your syntax usage is correct. If you&#8217;re
 still having trouble, send an email to the discussion list.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are sending an error report to the discussion list, please be sure to
do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>narrow down the problem to the smallest example that replicates the issue</li>
<li>be sure to include your input, the output you received, and the output you
 expected to get</li>
<li>if you&#8217;re convinced this is an issue with MultiMarkdown, use the issue
 tracker on <a href="https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown/issues">github</a>,
 otherwise the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/multimarkdown/">discussion list</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="divideandconquer">How do I find the source of an error?</h4>

<p>When you have a longer document that MultiMarkdown can&#8217;t successfully process,
it is helpful to narrow down the actual source of the problem. I recommend
that you recursively split the document into halves until you reach the source
of the issue. I also call this technique &#8220;Divide and Conquer&#8221;.</p>

<p>Basically, divide your document into two halves and try to process each one
separately. If one half works, and the other doesn&#8217;t, the problem is likely in
the half that won&#8217;t compile. Continue recursively dividing the problem piece
in half, until you narrow in on the actual problem.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that some parts of the document would potentially need to be
included in both halves for proper testing &#8212; the metadata, and the
definition of any images or links by reference, for example.</p>

<p>Obviously, if an error requires two pieces of the document to occur, and one
piece is in the beginning and the other is at the end, this approach might
fail to localize the problem. So, it&#8217;s not perfect, but is quite useful.</p>

<h4 id="whatideasarethereforthefutureofmultimarkdown">What ideas are there for the future of MultiMarkdown?</h4>

<h5 id="morecomplexsyntaxfortables">More complex syntax for tables</h5>

<p>Several users have written with suggestions for additional syntax for tables
in order to allow cells to span multiple rows, to allow the MMD source for a
single table row to span multiple text rows, etc.</p>

<p>My concern here is that the table should be easily understood in plain text,
without too much markup. Ideally, there would be no markup, but it&#8217;s just too
complicated to have MMD figure out what the layout means.</p>

<p>I welcome suggestions, but I plan to be somewhat strict on this one&#8230;. And
remember, for complex tables you can always enter the raw HTML.</p>

<h5 id="asyntaxforaddingforms">A syntax for adding forms?</h5>

<p>This is less likely to happen, but it seems that adding some sort of basic
syntax to manage forms would be pretty easy, and not very intrusive. Something
like:</p>

<pre><code>Please check all that apply:

[ ] Option A
[ ] Option B
[ ] Option C

Please choose one of the following:

( ) Option A
( ) Option B
( ) Option C

Please enter your first name:

[_______________________]
</code></pre>

<p>The idea would be to allow you to easily enter the necessary fields for a
form, but not have to be concerned with the HTML nonsense&#8230;. As always,
input welcome.</p>

<h5 id="howdoisubmitanideaformultimarkdown">How do I submit an idea for MultiMarkdown?</h5>

<p>First, my goal with MultiMarkdown is <em>not</em> to continue to add scores of
features. More is not always better.</p>

<p>If there is a feature that you can&#8217;t live without, and you are interested in
submitting your idea, think through the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Can your idea be done with the existing setup &#8212; for example, using XSLT or
 a quick post-processing script to convert the default output to the output
 you desire?</p></li>
<li><p>Does the raw source you are proposing look natural to a human reader? The
 less markup the better &#8212; the raw MultiMarkdown should look like something
 written by and for people, not for a computer.</p></li>
<li><p>How many people need this feature? MultiMarkdown has now been around for
 quite a while &#8212; why hasn&#8217;t someone else already requested this feature if
 it&#8217;s so important?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel your idea should be included in MultiMarkdown, then send it to the
discussion list and I will certainly review it.</p>

<h5 id="whatisapeg">What is a PEG?</h5>

<p>A PEG, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">Parsing Expression Grammar</a> is a method of
describing a formal grammar to parse an input language. John MacFarlane used a
PEG to create his <a href="https://github.com/jgm/peg-markdown">peg-markdown</a>. I then
modified his work to create MultiMarkdown 3.0.</p>

<p>First &#8212; RTF is really an inferior document format. A given RTF document will
give very different appearances when opened with different applications, or
even in the same application on different operating systems. Apple&#8217;s
implementation of RTF is very different from Microsoft&#8217;s, which is different
from that of everyone else. It&#8217;s hard to take RTF seriously as a document
format when it seems to be handled differently everywhere you look.</p>

<p>Ironically, MultiMarkdown never <em>really</em> had RTF support to begin with. The
initial approach to generating RTF output was to convert to HTML, and then use
Apple&#8217;s <code>textutil</code> command to convert to RTF. This can still be done via the
terminal, or simply use TextEdit to open the HTML and then save as RTF &#8212;
this effectively does the same thing, except that this approach can also
handle images.</p>

<p>A second approach was started, but never completed &#8212; the <code>xhtml2rtf.xslt</code>
file was used to convert HTML to RTF via an XSL stylesheet. This approach was
never finished, but could also be updated to work with MMD 3 generated HTML
output.</p>

<p>Because of all this, RTF &#8220;support&#8221; is no longer included with MMD. You can
easily modify a shell script to pipe the HTML command through the <code>textutil
-convert rtf -stdout</code> command and save to the desired filename, just like in
MMD 2.0. But an approach that gives better results is to use the Flat
OpenDocument format instead. This can be opened in LibreOffice or OpenOffice,
and then saved to a large variety of document formats.</p>

<p>A better approach might be to stick with the <code>.fodt</code> format, or the more
common version &#8212; <code>.odt</code>. But that&#8217;s more of a &#8220;political&#8221; opinion than a
technical one.</p>

<p>In addition to the core <code>peg-markdown</code> code, MultiMarkdown 3.0 makes use of
the <code>glib2</code> and <code>intl</code> libraries that are a part of <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> and licensed under
the GNU LGPL 2.1. Also, it relies on <a href="http://piumarta.com/software/peg/"><code>peg</code> and
<code>leg</code></a> to create the actual parser.</p>
